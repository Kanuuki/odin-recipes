      <p> This mixture of meat and tomato sauce goes by different names:
        Toasted Deviled Hamburgers, CHopped Meat Sandwiches, Spanish Hamburgers,
        Hamburg a la Creolo, Beef Mironton, and Minced Beef Spanish Style.
        Sloppy joe have been mentioned as early as the 1930s. Some believe that
        the original came from Sioux City, Iowa where a cook named Joe added
        tomato sauce to his "loose meat" sandwiches. Others say that the original
        came from Key West, Florida, Sloppy Joe's Bar. Which ever it was, thank
        goodness it exists!</p>
